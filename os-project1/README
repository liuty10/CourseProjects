Memory Management
virtual to physical Translation

This is a course projects from Tongping Liu's class:
https://github.com/liuty10/CourseProjects.git

How I implemented the LRU:
I use a FIFO to track history memory accesses.  
I add the page number to the FIFO each time when there is a memory access. 
When doing LRU replacement, I just count the numbers of each frame remaining 
in the FIFO and choose the one that appears the smallest time in current FIFO.
